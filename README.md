# Cookiecutter for ML projects

This cookiecutter is inspired by the [Cookiecutter for Data Science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/) and one published on the [Practical Business Python Blog](https://pbpython.com/notebook-process.html). 

## Features 

* `.gitignore` from [gitignore.io](https://www.gitignore.io/)
* creates automatically a conda enviornment for the project with a lot of useful packages. Note that we use the CPU version of Tensorflow as the GPU version is a bit annoying to install
* useful directory structure 

## To be added 

* DS unittests with [marbles](https://github.com/twosigma/marbles)
* `.json` or `.yaml` templates to save experiment parameters 
* Data science version control with [DVC](https://dvc.org/)
